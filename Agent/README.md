# Voice AI Agent Project

This repository contains my personal project about building a Voice AI Agent. The content is organized by two casestudies and includes Jupyter notebooks and requirements files related to the development and study of Voice AI technologies.

## Folder Structure

- `Case1/` - Materials for Case 1
  - `Lesson4.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook for Case 1
  - `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies for Case 1
- `Case2/` - Materials for Case 2
  - `Lesson5.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook for Case 2
  - `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies for Case 2

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired lesson folder (e.g., `Case1` or `Case2`).
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the Jupyter notebook with:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook Case1.ipynb
   ```
   or
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook Case2.ipynb
   ```

## Notes
